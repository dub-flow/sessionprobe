# SessionProbe âš¡
`SessionProbe` is a multi-threaded pentesting tool designed to assist in evaluating user privileges in web applications. It takes a user's session cookie and checks for a list of URLs if access is possible, highlighting potential authorization issues. `SessionProbe` deduplicates URL lists and provides real-time logging and progress tracking.

`SessionProbe` is intended to be used with `Burp Suite's` "Copy URLs in this host" functionality in the `Target` tab.
